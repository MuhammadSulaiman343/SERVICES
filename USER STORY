As a business analyst,
I want to enhance the procedures component,
so that I can make it easier for users to differentiate between current and future procedures.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

Scenario 1: Adding an Expected Date Field 
GIVEN: The user has navigated to the Procedures component
WHEN: The user adds a procedure
THEN: There will be an "Expected Date" field 

Business Rules:
The field will be added to the component from both the Provider Notes and Clinical workflow 
Next to the Expected Date field, there will be two options: Today and Future
There will be radio buttons and "Today" will be selected by default
When the user selects "Future", the following fields will be displayed:
Date field with date control
1 Week, 2 Weeks, 1 Month, 3 Months, and 6 Months buttons
These fields will only be displayed when "Future" is selected and not when "Today" is selected
The user will be able to select the date from the calendar or type in a date
The user will only be able to enter dates of the future - the current and past dates will be disabled
If the user presses one of the buttons, it will be displayed in selected form and the date will be auto-populated in the date field 
The "Expected Date" field will be added on the test level and the user will be able to enter different dates for different tests in the same order

Scenario 2: Population on SOAP
GIVEN: Scenario 1 is successful
WHEN: The user saves and accepts a procedure
THEN: It will populate on the SOAP with the expected date

Business Rules:
The SOAP text for procedures will remain as it is with the addition of a "Expected Date" field
The date will be displayed in the format: "(Expected Date: 19/07/2024)"
The expected date will only populate on the SOAP when a future date has been selected 
It will not be displayed if the date selected is of today (the current date)

Scenario 3: Population on eSuperbill
GIVEN: Scenario 1 is successful
THEN: Only procedures ordered for today or past will be populated on the eSuperbill
AND: Only signed procedures will be populated on the eSuperbill

Business Rules:
When the user creates a draft procedure order, adds it to the note, and creates the eSuperbill, the CPT codes will not be displayed on the eSuperbill
When the user creates and signs a procedure order with the expected date set to the same day, the respective CPT code will be reflected on the eSuperbill
When the user creates and signs a procedure order with the expected date set to a past date, the respective CPT code will be reflected on the eSuperbill
When the user creates and signs a procedure order with a future expected date, the respective CPT code will not be reflected on the eSuperbill
Note: The CPT code will only be displayed on the date of the procedure i.e., expected date
The order can include both tests with an expected date of the same day and an expected date of the future (since expected dates are added at the test level). In this case, only a subset of the tests will be reflected on the eSuperbill
When the user creates and marks the procedure as ‘Sign and complete’, the system will display the CPT code on the eSuperbill, regardless of the expected date
In case the user has added multiple tests to an order with “Today” selected for some and a future expected date selected for the rest, there will be an error at the top stating “eSuperbill will not include the following tests:” and the tests with a future date selected will be listed there
